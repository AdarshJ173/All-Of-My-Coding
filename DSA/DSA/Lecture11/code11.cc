/// TIME & SPACE COMPLEXITY

/*
* TIME COMPLEXITY
-> IT IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME TAKEN BY AN ALGORITHM TO RUN
-> AS A FUNCTION OF LENGTH OF THE INPUT

* WHY?
-> FOR MAKING BETTER PROGRAMS
-> COMPARISION OF ALGORITHM


@ BIG O NOTATION -> UPPER BOUND ( AT MAX )
@ THETA Q -> FOR AVG-CASE COMPLEXITY
@ OMEGA -> LOWER BAND

/ CONSTANT TIME -> O(1)
/LINEAR TIME -> O(n)
/LOGARITHM TIME -> O(log n)
/QUADRATIC TIME -> O(n^2)
/CUBIC TIME -> O(n^3)
