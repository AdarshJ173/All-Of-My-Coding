Sure, I'll explain inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals in detail, including their theory and graphical representations, without code.

Inorder Traversal:
Inorder traversal is a way of visiting nodes in a binary tree by traversing the left subtree first, then visiting the root node, and finally traversing the right subtree. This traversal technique is particularly useful for binary search trees, as it visits the nodes in ascending order.

Here's a graphical representation of inorder traversal:

```
                    Root Node (10)
                        +
                        |
                +---+---+---+---+
                |                |
        Left Subtree          Right Subtree
            +---+---+              +---+---+
            |       |              |       |
        Node (5)  Node (8)      Node (15) Node (20)
            +   +---+   +          +---+       +---+
            |   |   |   |          |   |           |
        Leaf Leaf Leaf Leaf      Leaf Leaf       Leaf

Inorder Traversal: 5 -> 8 -> 10 -> 15 -> 20
```

Preorder Traversal:
Preorder traversal is a way of visiting nodes in a binary tree by first visiting the root node, then traversing the left subtree, and finally traversing the right subtree. This traversal technique is useful for creating a copy of the tree or for certain types of expression trees.

Here's a graphical representation of preorder traversal:

```
                    Root Node (10)
                        +
                        |
                +---+---+---+---+
                |                |
        Left Subtree          Right Subtree
            +---+---+              +---+---+
            |       |              |       |
        Node (5)  Node (8)      Node (15) Node (20)
            +   +---+   +          +---+       +---+
            |   |   |   |          |   |           |
        Leaf Leaf Leaf Leaf      Leaf Leaf       Leaf

Preorder Traversal: 10 -> 5 -> 8 -> 15 -> 20
```

Postorder Traversal:
Postorder traversal is a way of visiting nodes in a binary tree by first traversing the left subtree, then traversing the right subtree, and finally visiting the root node. This traversal technique is useful for certain types of expression trees and for deleting the entire binary tree.

Here's a graphical representation of postorder traversal:

```
                    Root Node (10)
                        +
                        |
                +---+---+---+---+
                |                |
        Left Subtree          Right Subtree
            +---+---+              +---+---+
            |       |              |       |
        Node (5)  Node (8)      Node (15) Node (20)
            +   +---+   +          +---+       +---+
            |   |   |   |          |   |           |
        Leaf Leaf Leaf Leaf      Leaf Leaf       Leaf

Postorder Traversal: 8 -> 5 -> 20 -> 15 -> 10
```

In all three traversal methods, the order in which the nodes are visited depends on the relative positions of the root node, left subtree, and right subtree. These traversal techniques are fundamental for performing various operations on binary trees, such as searching, insertion, deletion, and tree manipulation.
