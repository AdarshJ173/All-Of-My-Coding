# RECURSION IS THE PROCESS OF DEFINING SOMETHING IN TERMS OF ITSELF.
# it is simply calling the function in itself

'''Fibonacci Sequence'''
# In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Numbers that are part of the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1, although some authors start the sequence from 1 and 1 or sometimes (as did Fibonacci) from 1 and 2. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
